# rePlace: /r/place project reloaded

### Data

The original interactions dataset can be found here:  
(interactions data)[https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/]

Artwork data are included in the repo with the following format:  

group_export.csv format: x,y,artwork_id  

x,y are in the original coordinate system (the same that can be downloaded from Reddit)  

the groups_id SHOULD be the same as the original atlas file that can be found (here)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RolandR/place-atlas/master/web/_js/atlas.js]  
This could be used to link artworks to their respective subreddits
